This file serves as the code book for the Getting and Ccleaning Data Course Project

Other details about the project can be found in the Readme.txt file. 


Identifiers used to merge the data files:

subject_id - the Id used for the subjects in the study (1 to 30)
activity_id - the ID used to identify the type of avtivity being measured (1 to 6)
activity_name - the description provided for each activity_id (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)

Measures included in the aggregated dataset: NOTE: details of the measures can be found features_info.txt file located in the original data here https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
